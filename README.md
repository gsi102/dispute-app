# Getting Started with Dispute App

It's an app for practice in React Development. The main idea - online-debates. Appearance and interface will be almost the same as on Twitch. Backend code: https://github.com/gsi102/server.git

## Idea

The app will give you the opportunity to have discussions with strict rules and boundaries which participants would choose by themselves.

## Roles for Dispute

There will be four different roles for registered users: admin (a leader/master for each dispute), participant (a person who would have side in a discussion), spectator (an user who can follow debates and write comments in spectators' chat) and moderator (admin who can moderate spectators' chat only).

Unregistered users could watch the debates only, without writing in Spectators Chat.

## Modes

It could be a way to train your rhetoric skills or a real philosophical duel to find where the truth is. There will be different modes. For example:

- Mode with a short text length cap like on Twitter, where you will be proving your conviction using short messages;
- Blitz mode with a three-minutes response timeout;
- Mode with a random given theme, where you will randomly get your side in a dispute and practice in the art of rhetoric (Ex: "What is love?" 1. It's an emotional feeling 2. It's just a chemical process in the brain);
- "Socrates" mode which will allow you to answer the opponent's question only with question;
- "Versus" uncensored mode which allows you to battle with your opponent in a poetry form;
- Ranked disputes where you will compete with opponents who will have the same Disputes Win/Disputes Lose ratio;
 ...etc.
 
 All the debates could be in a text form or provided with short-video messages.

## Winner

There could be different voting modes:

- Spectators would vote for the winner;
- Third-party person (or group of respectable persons) would decide who wins;
  ...etc.

## Encouraging/Rating system

There could be a rating system where you would get/lose points for each dispute you won/lose. Encouraging system with points for win-streak.

## P.S.

I can come up with a lot of different functions and features, but for now the main goal is practice in development.
