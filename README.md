# Getting Started with Dispute App

It's an app for practice in React Development. Main idea - online-debates. Appearance and interface blocks will be the same as on Twitch. Backend code: https://github.com/gsi102/server.git

## Idea

The app will give you the opportunity to have discussions on the Internet with strict rules and boundaries.

## Roles

There will be four different roles for registered users: admin (leader/master for each dispute), participant (person who would have side in a discussion), spectator, and moderator (for spectators' chat).

Only one role for unregistered user: visitor (spectator who couldn't write in the chat).

## Modes

It could be a way to train your rhetoric skills or a real philosophical duel to find where the truth is. There will be different modes. For example:

- Mode with a short text length cap like on Twitter, where you should prove your conviction using short messages;
- Blitz mode with a one-minute response limit;
- Mode with random given theme, where you randomly get your side in a dispute and practice in the art of rhetoric (Ex: "What is love?" 1. It's an emotional feeling 2. It's just a chemical process in the brain);
- "Socrates" mode which allows you to answer the opponent's question only with question;
  ...etc.

## Winner

There could be different voting modes:

- Spectators would vote for the winner;
- Third-party person (or some persons) would decide who wins;
  ...etc.

## Encouraging/Rating system

There could be a rating system where you would get/lose points for each dispute you won/lose.

## P.S.

I can come up with a lot of different functions and features, but for now the main goal is to practice Development.
